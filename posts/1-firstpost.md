  Hi, I'm fikisipi and this is a webdev/distributed programming blog.

Hi, I'm fikisipi and this is going to be a programming/science/forecasting blog. The name fikisipi is a mashup from 'pikisipi' - a Macedonian rapper and 'fiki' - a Macedonian nickname for my first name.

Some facts about me:

- I focus on the songs' lyrics more than their melody. I like various rock & hip-hop stuff but I often forget song names
- I like low-level programming and fiddling with ugly bytes in green terminal screens
- ... and yet I love optimizing user experience, design & making beautiful products
