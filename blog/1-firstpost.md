  Hi, I'm fikisipi and this is going to be a science/nerdsphere
  and design blog. The name fikisipi is a mashup from 'pikisipi' - a Macedonian rapper and 'fiki' - a Macedonian nickname for my first name.

Some facts about me:

* I focus on the songs' lyrics more than their melody. I like various rock & hip-hop stuff but I often forget song names
* I like low-level programming and fiddling with ugly bytes in green terminal screens
* ... and yet I love optimizing user experience, design & making beautiful products
* I think distributed computing & system optimization isn't useful for product/app prototypes but it's very fun
