  Hi, I'm fikisipi and this is a webdev/distributed programming blog.

Hi, I'm fikisipi and this is going to be a programming/science/forecasting blog. The name **fikisipi** is a mashup of *fiki* - a nickname of mine and *pikisipi* - a Macedonian rapper that's part of the SAF trio.

Some stuff about me:

- I like low-level programming and fiddling with ugly bytes in green terminal screens ü§ì
- ... but I love optimizing user experience, design & making beautiful products ‚≠ê
- music-wise: I enjoy rock & hip-hop stuff, as well as Macedonian Schlagers - an old local pop genre. Check out [Shlagz mixtape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZjGJA_L1VM) by Nenad Stefanovski (aka Brus).
