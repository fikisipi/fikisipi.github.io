  Hi, I'm fikisipi and this is a webdev/distributed programming blog.

Hi, I'm fikisipi and this is going to be a programming/science/forecasting blog. The name **fikisipi** is a mashup from *pikisipi* - a Macedonian rapper and *fiki* - a nickname of mine.

Some stuff about me:

- I like low-level programming and fiddling with ugly bytes in green terminal screens
- ... but I love optimizing user experience, design & making beautiful products
- I like various rock & hip-hop stuff
