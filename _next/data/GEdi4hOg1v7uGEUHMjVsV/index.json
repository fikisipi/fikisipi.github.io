The name fikisipi is a mashup from 'pikisipi' - a Macedonian rapper and 'fiki' - a Macedonian nickname for my first name.\n\nSome facts about me:\n\n- I focus on the songs' lyrics more than their melody. I like various rock & hip-hop stuff but I often forget song names\n- I like low-level programming and fiddling with ugly bytes in green terminal screens\n- ... and yet I love optimizing user experience, design & making beautiful products\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
